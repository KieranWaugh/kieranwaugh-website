abstract: Touchless gesture interfaces enable user interaction without the need
  for direct physical contact. Recently there has been increased interest in
  deploying such interfaces over concerns about touchscreen sterility. Many
  touchless displays use gestures that mimic pointer-based interactions, with a
  `cursor' mapped to finger position, that users activate by `pushing' their
  finger forwards. Mid-air pushing with a virtual cursor is fine for discrete
  interactions like button activation; however, users have difficulty exerting
  control over continuous interactions like sliding and scrolling, because it is
  challenging to keep the hand at a consistent depth when gesturing. We
  investigate interaction techniques for slider control that use alternative
  mode switches between (un)pressed states. Our findings show that pinch
  gestures are preferred by most users and offer a faster alternative for
  acquiring control of sliders, as pinching has two clearly defined states and
  avoids the ambiguous use of depth for delineating input states.
