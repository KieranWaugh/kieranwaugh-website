abstract: Touchless displays often use mid-air gestures to control on-screen
  cursors for pointer interactions. Area cursors can simplify touchless cursor
  input by implicitly targeting nearby widgets without the cursor entering the
  target. However, for displays with dense target layouts, the cursor still has
  to arrive close to the widget, meaning the benefits of area cursors for
  time-to-target and effort are diminished. Through two experiments, we
  demonstrate for the first time that fine-tuning the mapping between hand and
  cursor movements (control-display gain â€“ CDG) can address the deficiencies of
  area cursors and improve the performance of touchless interaction. Across
  several display sizes and target densities (representative of myriad public
  displays used in retail, transport, museums, etc), our findings show that the
  forgiving nature of an area cursor compensates for the imprecision of a high
  CDG, helping users interact more effectively with smaller and more controlled
  hand/arm movements.
