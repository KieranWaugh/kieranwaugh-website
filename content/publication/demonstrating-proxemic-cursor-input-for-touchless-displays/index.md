abstract: Touchless gesture interfaces often use cursor-based interactions,
  where widgets are targeted by a movable cursor and activated with a mid-air
  gesture. Proxemic cursor interactions are a novel alternative that facilitate
  faster selection without the need for direct targeting. We present an
  interactive demonstration exhibit that uses proxemic cursor interactions for
  input to a touchless public display.
