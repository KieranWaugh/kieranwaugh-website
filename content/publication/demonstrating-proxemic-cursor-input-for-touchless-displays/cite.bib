abstract = {Touchless gesture interfaces often use cursor-based interactions, where widgets are targeted by a movable cursor and activated with a mid-air gesture. Proxemic cursor interactions are a novel alternative that facilitate faster selection without the need for direct targeting. We present an interactive demonstration exhibit that uses proxemic cursor interactions for input to a touchless public display.},
