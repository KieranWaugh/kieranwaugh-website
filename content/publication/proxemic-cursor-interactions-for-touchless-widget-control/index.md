abstract: Touchless gesture interfaces often use cursor-based interactions,
  where widgets are targeted by a movable cursor and activated with a mid-air
  gesture (e.g., push or Pinch). Continuous interactions like slider
  manipulation can be challenging in mid-air because users need to precisely
  target widgets and then maintain an `activated' state whilst moving the
  cursor. We investigated proxemic cursor interactions as a novel alternative,
  where cursor proximity allows users to acquire and keep control of user
  interface widgets without precisely targeting them. Users took advantage of
  proxemic targeting, though gravitated towards widgets when negotiating the
  boundaries between multiple elements. This allowed users to gain control more
  quickly than with non-proxemic behaviour, and made it easier to move between
  user interface elements. We find that proxemic cursor interactions can improve
  the usability of touchless user interfaces, especially for slider
  interactions, paving the way to more comfortable and efficient use of
  touchless displays.
