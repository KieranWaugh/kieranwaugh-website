abstract: Public touchscreens are filthy and, regardless of how often they are
  cleaned, they pose a considerable risk in the transmission of bacteria and
  viruses. While we rely on their use, we should find a feasible alternative to
  touch devices. Non-touch interaction, via the use of mid-air gestures, has
  been previously labelled as not user-friendly and unsuitable. However,
  previous works have extensively compared such interaction to precise mouse
  movements. In this paper, we investigate and compare the usability of an
  interface controlled via a touchscreen and a non-touch device. Participants (N
  = 22) using a touchscreen and the Leap Motion Controller, performed tasks on a
  mock-up ticketing machine, later evaluating their experience using the System
  Usability and Gesture Usability scales. Results show that, in contrast to the
  previous works, the non-touch method was usable and quickly learnable. We
  conclude with recommendations for future work on making a non-touch interface
  more user-friendly.
